# üèõÔ∏è Computational Model for Transition Risk Capital Buffer

## üí° Introduction

This repository holds the code and analysis developed for the **Master's Research Thesis** by **Lorenzo van Cadsand**.

The primary objective of this project is to **define a capital buffer for transition risk using a simulation approach, applying VaR as the risk measure to the empirical transition risk loss distribution.** This factor should be added to the credit risk add-on defined by Gordy's in "A risk-factor model foundation for ratings-based bank capital rules" in case a climate policy would be introduced according to a specific IAM scenario. 
The total add-on is equal to the sum of the two factors, assuming the independence between undiversified idiosyncratic risk and the introduction of a climate policy. 

The empirical transition risk loss distribution is calculated across a range of num_simulations steps, each one involving the association of every exposures included in the portfolio with a fossil, renewable, or mixed technology mix (according to max_percentages and max_subsectors_per_sector variables), as per CPRS mapping. 
The total transition risk portfolio loss is subsequently defined by the aggregation of the Individual transition risk losses of each exposure (computed according to Monasterolo & Battiston climate valuation framework) are then aggregated for every simulation.

The core of the analysis and simulation is contained within the **Jupyter Notebook**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Parameters

The simulation relies on a set of critical parameters, which are defined and controlled within the main Jupyter Notebook. Understanding these parameters is essential for running the model:

| Parameter Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `num_simulations` | The total number of Monte Carlo simulations to be executed for the VaR calculation. --> in my model = 10.000|
| `max_subsectors_per_sector` | The maximum number of sub-sectors considered within each primary economic sector in the model. --> in my model = 3|
| `max_percentages` | This parameter indicates the maximum allowed percentage of fossil fuel or renewable energy production exposure within the simulated portfolios --> must sum up to 100.|
| `percentile(argument)` | The percentile considered for VaR calculation.|

## üìä Data & Results Structure

The results and analysis are structured to allow for both regional and global assessments of the transition risk add-on. 
The code define the results for each region included in LIMITS database and allows for a comparison between different IAM model/ scenario combinations. 

### Regional Analysis

Results for specific geographic regions are obtained by analyzing the dedicated input files:

* **`shock_region`**: Contains the shock data specifically tailored to the regional economic and policy environment, obtained by the LIMITS database. 
* **`portfolio_region`**: Contains the portfolio exposure data for institutions focusing solely on a specific region, where assets/ liabilities/ LGD are simulated according to Gordy's.

To run the simulation you can use the csv file contained in the repository. 

### Global Portfolio Analysis

Results for global portfolios (those with exposure across multiple regions) are derived from the following input and output files:

* **`portafogliosimulazioni copia`**: The input file detailing the composition and exposure of the globally diversified portfolios used in the simulation.
* **`shock_results_final(in).csv`**: The output file containing the final simulated shock results, used as the primary input for the final VaR and capital buffer calculations.

Actual global exposure in uploaded portfolio is: 35% North America, 20% Europe, 20% Asia, 10% South America, 10% Africa, 5% Rest of the world (Oceania).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Model

The analysis and simulation scripts are located in the main notebook.

1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure all required Python dependencies are installed (e.g., via a `requirements.txt` file).
2.  **Launch Jupyter:** Open your terminal in the project folder and start the Jupyter environment:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    (or `jupyter lab`)
3.  **Execute:** Open the file **`Gitversion-tesi.ipynb`** and run all cells in sequential order to replicate the full analysis and generate the capital buffer results.
